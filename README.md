### About

This project is written on NextJs framework.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

-  [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)  - learn about Next.js features and API.

-  [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn)  - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

Also I've used material ui for design. To get start and find its documentation please take a look at [HERE](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/)

### Getting Started

First of things you should clone or download the project on your local machine.

It's depend on you to use them, but I prefer the yarn.

To start the project run:

yarn dev
````
wait to run the development server, then open http://localhost:3000 (or other port which the dev server is on it)
